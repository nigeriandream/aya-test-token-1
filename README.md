# MagicToken

This code is a Solidity smart contract for a MagicTokenCTR token. It defines functions to transfer tokens, check a user's balance, and burn tokens. It also includes modifiers to restrict certain functions to only the owner of the contract and requires that the contract is not paused before performing certain actions. The constructor sets the name, symbol, decimals, and total supply of the token. The code also includes an event to log transfers of tokens.
